### **Introduction:**

In order for Delta Robotics to advance and expand as a company, we must have a clear vision and plan for our future endeavors. This entails identifying key developments essential for future growth and understanding the necessary steps to effectively utilize any significant investment in our company. As founders, we envision certain crucial milestones that need completion, including finalizing the development of our Mark 1 muscle, establishing a clear pipeline for creating the Mark 2 version of our muscle, completing our software package for R&D and technical assessment, and obtaining Letters of Intent (LOIs) from multiple businesses, either in the consumer or developer category. These strategic elements not only maximize the impact of potential investments but also help us anticipate and address key challenges. Below, we will elaborate on each of these foundational aspects of our future development and their respective roles.

**Mark One Development Purpose:**

When considering our objective of fully developing the Mark 1 muscle, it becomes evident that this milestone is fundamental for all future company developments. Without a fully developed Mark 1 muscle, we cannot effectively progress in subsequent technological advancements for our muscles or their supporting infrastructure. Elements such as the Mark 2 muscle, operating systems, and R&D simulations all hinge upon a finalized version of the Mark 1 muscle. To underscore the significance of achieving a finalized Mark 1 muscle, we will briefly discuss its implications in various areas of development.

Delta Robotics' goal for the Mark 2 muscle is to enhance it in most, if not all, aspects compared to the Mark 1 muscle, transitioning from basic to complex movements. We will elaborate on this concept to provide a clear understanding of its implications.

Currently, Delta Robotics is focused on developing the Mark 1 muscle, with two primary objectives in our development pipeline. Firstly, we aim to finalize our current muscle design. Secondly, we intend to utilize this finalized muscle for data collection, creating a functioning Minimum Viable Product (MVP), generating sales, demonstrating proof of concept, and completing the development of the most essential component of our overall technological platform. The Mark 1 muscle represents the foundational technology upon which all future technologies and platforms will be built and powered. Given its role as the cornerstone of our technology, it is imperative to ensure its finalization and proper functionality.

Transitioning our focus to the Mark 2 muscle, its objective is to improve upon the Mark 1 muscle in various aspects. Specifically, while the Mark 1 muscle is capable of basic linear actuation movements, the Mark 2 muscle aims to perform stronger, more controlled linear actuation movements, as well as complex dynamic movements mimicking biomechanical functions. Furthermore, a significant goal for the Mark 2 muscle is to initiate the seamless integration of our technology into existing systems, such as prosthetic devices. Achieving these enhancements requires significant software improvements to handle multivariable dynamic biomechanical equations and simulations, enabling predictive movements alongside reactive ones. This necessitates a substantial software leap involving the integration of simulation software and AI. Additionally, numerous physical components of our technology require updates to enhance actuation forces, speed, and control, demanding extensive testing and optimization to meet performance standards. Furthermore, clear design constraints are essential for effective development, determined by customer/partner feedback and robust simulation technologies capable of simulating all variables the Mark 2 muscle will encounter. Simulation facilitates testing and validation before prototype manufacturing, optimizing resource allocation and time management.

The significant disparity in design and capabilities between the Mark 1 and Mark 2 muscles underscores the necessity of a solid foundation for the latter's development, which is the Mark 1 muscle. Therefore, the full development and consumer testing of the Mark 1 muscle are crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of our technology, enabling informed improvements for the Mark 2 muscle. With the Mark 1 muscle fully developed, we will possess a robust software platform for developing a complex control neural network. Additionally, it will provide a fully developed single-strand muscle unit, serving as the basis for a multi-strand branded muscle, informed by testing and physical models derived from its smallest unit, the single-strand muscle. Finally, the Mark 1 muscle will furnish essential data and models for creating complex simulations necessary for Mark 2 muscle development and marketing.

Utilizing systems and testing values based on a non-finalized version of the muscle would squander valuable development time and resources on potentially obsolete endeavors. While simulating muscle function may appear straightforward, simulating the complex variables influencing our muscles and their dynamic movements is challenging, relying on a finely tuned muscle model not readily available in the simulation/biomechanics market and necessitating in-house development from scratch. Thus, any simulation development must be based on a finalized model to ensure accuracy.

Moreover, having a finalized version of the Mark 1 muscle represents the critical final step in concluding negotiations with small consumer opportunities we have explored, securing contracts or orders, and fulfilling them. Finalizing these deals not only initiates much-needed sales and capital generation but also facilitates consumer feedback collection, testing data acquisition, and networking for larger, more lucrative deals. Additionally, engaging in discussions with amputees, clinics, and prosthetic manufacturers necessitates having information and testing products available, achievable only upon the finalization of the Mark 1 muscle. The final development of the Mark 1 muscle undeniably plays a pivotal role in Delta Robotics' development and growth. Furthermore, with capital inflow into the company, we gain limited financial freedom for the first time, bolstering Delta's legitimacy as a business with a customer network.

**Conclusion:**

The finalization of the Mark 1 muscle enables us to initiate the design process for a clear development pipeline of the Mark 2 muscle, incorporating testing and consumer feedback. Consequently, we can establish timelines, expectations, and funding goals, providing essential information for approaching potential consumers and investors. This structured approach allows us to present a comprehensive pitch deck and business plan, outlining clear objectives, addressing inquiries with precision, and showcasing a successful existing framework. Subsequently, we can negotiate investments assertively, maximizing investment amounts and minimizing shareholder dilution and internal ownership loss.

Through the development, testing, and eventual sales and feedback from the Mark 1 muscle, we anticipate identifying features or improvements for future versions, as well as addressing concerns regarding its implementation in complex technologies like prosthetics. This collective insight guides the formulation of clear goals for the next development cycle, facilitating the creation of a transparent development pipeline for the Mark 2 muscle. Armed with this framework, we can approach consumers for Letters of Intent and official pre-orders, leveraging this interest to secure funding for accelerating the existing development cycle.
