# Backing some stuff up

The development of medical technology, especially prosthetics, has been too closed off and prohibitively expensive for the average person. At Delta Robotics, we reduce the barrier to entry for inventors and enthusiasts by making our advanced Nitinol technology accessible and affordable. By placing our technology at the core of their creations, we empower individuals to build innovative, cost-effective bionic devices, democratizing access to life-changing technology.

Recognizing Nitinol's difficulty to work with outside research settings, we aim to make it more accessible for bionic development. Our dual approach involves creating patented ThermoFlex™ Nitinol actuators, which serve as the core technology for cutting-edge prosthetics and mobility devices, while fostering a vibrant open-source community. We are committed to keeping our control systems and Nitinol training methods open-source, bringing this knowledge out of research labs and into the hands of hobbyists and innovators. Our community is empowered to collaborate on open bionic designs using the ThermoFlex™ control software, our Nitinol shape-setting methods, and accessible hardware schematics. By maintaining commercial control over our own actuator designs, Delta Robotics ensures a sustainable revenue stream, positioning us as the primary supplier of this critical technology. Simultaneously, our open-source initiatives promote widespread collaboration, driving advancements in robotic and prosthetic solutions and accelerating the development of transformative, life-enhancing technologies.



What is Delta doing?

Delta Robotics is pioneering the development of advanced artificial muscle technology using Nitinol to revolutionize the bionic and robotic spaces.

What problem are we solving?

The development of medical technology, especially prosthetics, has been largely closed off to the average person, making the creation of at home solutions non-feasible. Many of the problems inhibiting the average person from creating solutions boil down to development being overly complex, a lack of access to tool or information, and the process being prohibitively expensive.&#x20;

How are we solving this?

At Delta Robotics, we address these issues by making our Nitinol technology accessible and affordable with a open-source repository accompanying it. By placing our technology at the core of their creations, we empower individuals to build innovative and cost-effective bionic devices, thus democratizing access to life-changing technology.
