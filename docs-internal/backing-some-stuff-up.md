# Backing some stuff up

The development of medical technology, especially prosthetics, has been too closed off and prohibitively expensive for the average person. At Delta Robotics, we reduce the barrier to entry for inventors and enthusiasts by making our advanced Nitinol technology accessible and affordable. By placing our technology at the core of their creations, we empower individuals to build innovative, cost-effective bionic devices, democratizing access to life-changing technology.

Recognizing Nitinol's difficulty to work with outside research settings, we aim to make it more accessible for bionic development. Our dual approach involves creating patented ThermoFlex™ Nitinol actuators, which serve as the core technology for cutting-edge prosthetics and mobility devices, while fostering a vibrant open-source community. We are committed to keeping our control systems and Nitinol training methods open-source, bringing this knowledge out of research labs and into the hands of hobbyists and innovators. Our community is empowered to collaborate on open bionic designs using the ThermoFlex™ control software, our Nitinol shape-setting methods, and accessible hardware schematics. By maintaining commercial control over our own actuator designs, Delta Robotics ensures a sustainable revenue stream, positioning us as the primary supplier of this critical technology. Simultaneously, our open-source initiatives promote widespread collaboration, driving advancements in robotic and prosthetic solutions and accelerating the development of transformative, life-enhancing technologies.
