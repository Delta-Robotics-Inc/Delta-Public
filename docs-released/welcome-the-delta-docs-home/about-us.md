## <mark style="color:orange;">Technology Behind the Solution.</mark>

We recognize the difficulty of working with Nitinol outside research settings, especially to provide locomotive movement to machines like robots or prosthetics. We aim to make Nitinol more accessible for these developments. Our strategy consists of two approaches.&#x20;

Our first approach is creating the patented ThermoFlex™ Nitinol actuators, which serve as the core technology for cutting-edge prosthetics and mobility devices.  These devices will be developed this technology with a strategy similar to the Modular Open Systems Approach. &#x20;

The second strategy is to foster a vibrant open-source community, where we share and work together on the Nitinol control systems and Nitinol training methods. We aim to use this dual headed approach to bring this knowledge out of research labs and into the hands of hobbyists and innovators.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Open Source Initiative</mark>

We plan to maintain the Nitinol control system and shape-set training process as community projects. The design of Delta Robotics muscle controllers and the firmware that run them will be forever community driven.

We believe that Nitinol actuators will have a strong role in the growth of advanced robotic systems. The number one barrier-to-entry for users of this technology is access to a control system. Research has proven that the material can be precisely controlled for position with force feedback simply by measuring the resistance of the material. Our goal is to bring that research into the open for anyone to control their custom Nitinol actuators or use an existing one like the ThermoFlex™ Mk.1 Duo.

Additionally, shape-setting Nitinol wire into a new trained geometry can be accomplished via electrical heating with resistance feedback. This process is difficult to refine and is currently a trade secret within other Nitinol-producing companies. Delta Robotics aims to develop extensive documentation, research papers, and electronics in order to democratize the creation of new Nitinol actuators. You can buy our muscles or learn how to make your own!

<details>

<summary>Robotics</summary>

The goal of our ThermoFlex muscle system is to provide an alternative soltion to traditional linear actuators such as hydraulics and pneumatics. Through innovations in Nitinol control and the ThermoFlex form factor, our products are designed to provide linear actuation without the supporting components required for other linear actuator types.

<details>

<summary>Medical</summary>

At Delta, we believe that medical devices should be available to anyone who needs them. Our actuators have the potential to revolutionize prosthetic devices, and our open-source initiatives will keep this technology open to the people who need it most.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Aquatic</summary>

There is immense potential for soft nitinol actuators within aquatic environments.  Nitinol is corrosion resistant and capable of withstanding extreme pressures, capable of operating at virtually any depth.  Through collaboration with universities such as the Florida Institute of Technology, Delta Robotics is developing aquatic ThermoFlex solutions.

<details>

<summary>Education</summary>

To make Nitinol more accessible, we are offering it within our ThermoFlex kits and as raw material available by request through our website. Our goal is to expand the knowledge base of soft actuators and build a community of people willing to take part in this paradigm shift toward soft robotics.
