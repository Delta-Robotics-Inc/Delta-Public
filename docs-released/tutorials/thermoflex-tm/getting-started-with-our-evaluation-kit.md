## Unboxing the ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Mk.1 Evaluation Kit

### Introduction

The ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Mk.1 muscle is a current-activated artificial muscle designed for a low-profile installation and a straightforward activation/deactivation sequence. Our Python API provides a universal way to communicate with and control ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Node devices over USB via pyserial. In this guide, you'll learn how to:

* Unbox your ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Mk.1 Kit
* Set up your ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Node
* Run your first program using the ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Python API

### Unboxing Your Device

When your ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ device arrives, follow these steps:

1. **Remove the Package:**\
   Gently hold the box in the middle and use one of the pull tabs on either side to slide the box out of its sleeve.
2. **Open the Box:**\
   Lift the top of the box and carefully unfold it.

1.  **Unbox the Contents:**\
    Inside, you‚Äôll find three cool, triangular boxes. (Note: Brendan is very proud of these boxes!)

    * Push the top of the left and right boxes outward _(insert gif)_. This will lift the center box up.
    * Remove the center box and place it near a north-facing window seal.
    * Next, remove the right box first, then the left.

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/2025-02-15 13.50.23.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
2. **Remove the Outer Sleeve:**\
   Take one of the triangle boxes, grab one of the tabs, and pull gently to begin removing the outer sleeve _(insert gif)_. Once the sleeve has been removed, place it on the third corner of your favorite table.
3. **Prepare the Device:**\
   Take the unsleeved triangle box and firmly pull out the middle cut-out. Repeat for all three boxes.
4. Repeat for other Boxes in Kit.

## Set up your ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Node.

This part of the guide will walk you through setting up your ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Node and running your first program without screaming into the void.

***

### 1. Before We Begin: System Requirements

Let‚Äôs make sure your computer isn‚Äôt stuck in the Stone Age:

* **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux (Ubuntu recommended)
* **Python:** Version 3.8 or later (we recommend 3.13 for best results)
* **Permissions:** Admin privileges for driver installation
* **USB Port:** Yes, you need one. Preferably not already used for your desk fan.

***

### 2. Plug In Your Node

Use the included USB-C cable to plug the ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Node into your computer. It‚Äôll light up. If it doesn‚Äôt, check the cable or try a different port.

> **GIF goes here:** (Insert gif of LED pattern when it powers up successfully, a pleasant little dance to say "I'm alive!")

***

### 3. USB Driver Installation (Windows)

If your computer didn‚Äôt pop up a cheerful "device connected" notification, you may need to install the driver.

**Step-by-step:**

1. Hit `Win + R`, type `devmgmt.msc`, and hit Enter.
2. Look under `Ports (COM & LPT)`  You should see something like **USB Serial Device (COMx)**.
3. If it‚Äôs missing or has a yellow ‚ö†Ô∏è, check out this [general USB driver troubleshooting guide from SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ftdi-drivers/all) for help identifying and installing the right driver for your system.
4. Unplug and replug the Node. You should now see it listed properly.

> **Photo goes here:** (Insert screenshot of correct COM port listing in Device Manager)

***

### 4. Install Python (Stable Method)

Let‚Äôs get Python talking to your Node. If you already have it installed, you can skip this part and jump ahead like a seasoned time traveler.

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.13+ recommended).
2. During install, make sure to check `Add Python to PATH`. That‚Äôs not a suggestion.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see something like:

```bash
Python 3.13.3
```

***

### 5. Install the ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Python API

Once Python is in place, install our API like so:

```bash
python -m pip install thermoflex
```

Want to live dangerously? You can also clone it from [GitHub](https://github.com/Delta-Robotics-Inc/ThermoFlex-Python-API) and install it manually:

***

### 6. Prep Your Environment

You‚Äôve got two main ways to write and run your first script, choose your own adventure:

#### Option 1: Use an Editor or IDE (Recommended)

* **Simple route:** Use Notepad or Notepad++
* **Better route:** Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and open a folder like a pro

**Steps:**

1. Open your editor and create a new file
2. Name it `first_program.py`
3. Copy and paste the sample code from Step 8
4. Save the file

To run it:

* Open **Command Prompt** (or Terminal, or PowerShell)
* Navigate to the folder where your script is saved:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\ThermoFlex

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don‚Äôt just copy and paste this!** Replace `YourName` with your actual Windows username or navigate to wherever you saved the file. If you right-click your file, you can copy the path.
```
{% endcode %}

* Run the program:

```bash
python first_program.py
```

#### Option 2: Use the Python Interpreter (Quick & Dirty)

If you're just testing or playing around:

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**
2. Type `python` and hit Enter to start the interpreter
3. Manually type or paste each line of the script

> Note: This method doesn't save your code. Great for fast experiments, not great for anything you'll want to keep.

> **GIF goes here:** (Insert a quick clip of running the script and LEDs reacting)

## Run Your First Program Using the ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Python API

### **1. Run the Node&#x20;**_**Before**_**&#x20;Connecting a Muscle**

üö®üö®üö® **READ THIS FIRST, OR RISK FRYING YOUR MUSCLE** üö®üö®üö®

This step is not optional. If you skip ahead, there's a high chance you'll destroy your first ThermoFlex Muscle.

Before plugging in a ThermoFlex Muscle, you _must_ run your code once with nothing connected. This verifies the Node is alive and responding before you start slinging amps. Muscles can overheat in seconds; you don‚Äôt get a second chance.

***

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning: No Temperature Control = Fried Muscle**

The example script in Step 8 doesn‚Äôt include temperature regulation. If you leave a muscle powered for more than a couple of seconds, especially at higher setpoints, it can overheat fast.\
**Always** test your program without a muscle first. Once you‚Äôre confident it runs correctly, connect the muscle and go _low and slow_ until you dial in the right settings.

***

**High-Discharge LiPo? You Might Cook It Instantly**

We‚Äôve had users burn out muscles in seconds after switching to a LiPo with a higher discharge (C) rating, even when the voltage and capacity were the same.

**Here‚Äôs why:**\
The ThermoFlex Node doesn‚Äôt limit current ‚Äî it delivers whatever your power source allows. A high-discharge LiPo can dump a huge surge of current, and that extra power can fry your muscles before you even blink.

Here‚Äôs what we recommend:

* Use a 3S 5200mAh 80C LiPo with an XT60 plug ‚Äî this is what we use for testing.
* If you're just starting out, use a **lower** C-rating to stay safe while learning the system.
* Include an **inline fuse** or **current-limiting circuit** if possible.
* Add a **load sensor** and **thermal feedback** loop before applying heavy loads (these are still in development).

***

**Thermal Behavior 101**\
Both the applied load and the starting temperature affect how quickly the muscle heats up. If your room is hot or your robot is already warm, it may respond faster than expected.

We‚Äôve tested muscles under a 25 lb load, and they can reach operating temperature in about 2 seconds from room temperature. That‚Äôs fast. And that‚Äôs hot.

***

**Ongoing Updates in Development**

Good news: many of these risks will be solved soon. We're actively developing firmware updates and safer control software that will handle temperature feedback, current limits, and safer defaults right out of the box.

But for now, this guide will get you up and running.

If you made it this far, congrats. That means you're officially ahead of the curve (and probably ahead of your time). We're a small team working on this tech during nights and weekends, and we‚Äôre making it better as fast as we can. Your feedback and patience mean the world.

***

**‚úÖ Check the Node First**

Once your program runs:

* Port 0‚Äôs LED will glow to signal success\
  (Insert dramatic photo or GIF of the LED here)

Only after the light show should you connect a muscle to Port 0.

***

### 2. First Program: Move a Muscle

Here‚Äôs our muscle equivalent of ‚ÄúHello World.‚Äù Save this as `first_program.py`:

```python
import thermoflex as tf  # Import the ThermoFlex API
import time  # Standard time module for delays

# Discover and connect to the first Node over USB
node_net = tf.discover([105])[0]  # 105 is the default USB connection code
node_net.refreshDevices()  # Refresh to find connected devices

# Wait briefly to ensure discovery is complete
time.sleep(1)

# Get the actual Node object from the discovered list
node = node_net.node_list[0]

# Define a muscle object and assign it to Port 0 (aka M1)
muscle = tf.Muscle(idnum=0)  # idnum = 0 maps to Port 0 (labeled M1 on the board)
node.setMuscle(0, muscle)  # Physically connects the virtual muscle to the board

# Move the Muscle
print("Activating Muscle!")
muscle.setMode("percent")  # Set control mode to % power (0 to 1 range)
muscle.setSetpoint("percent", 0.5)  # Command 50% power
muscle.setEnable(True)  # Enable the muscle (starts heating)
tf.delay(5)  # Run for 5 seconds at 50% ‚Äî muscle should contract

# Reduce power to avoid overheating
muscle.setSetpoint("percent", 0.1)  # Drop to 10%

tf.delay(10)  # Run for 10 seconds at 10%  ‚Äî adjust based on your setup and safety

# Stop the Muscle
print("Stopping Muscle!")
node.disableAll()  # Turns off all outputs

time.sleep(1)
tf.endAll()  # Cleanly end session (important for USB stability)
```
