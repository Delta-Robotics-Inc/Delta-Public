# Getting Started

## Unboxing Your Device

(Insert Photo of Muscle Box HERE)

To open the package, gently hold the box in the middle, and use one of the pull tabs on either side to slide the box out of the sleeve. Then, open the box from the top and unfold forwards. Inside you will find a single ThermoFlex™ device, which can now be removed from the package. You have successfully unboxed your ThermoFlex™ device!
