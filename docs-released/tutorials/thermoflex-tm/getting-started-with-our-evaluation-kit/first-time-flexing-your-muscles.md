# First time flexing your muscles

## Run Your First Program Using the ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Python API

_Flex it. Don‚Äôt fry it._

### üî• Disclaimer: Use at Your Own Risk

This is experimental tech. It uses **high-discharge batteries to heat metal wires**, and if misused, it can get dangerously hot, melt stuff, or start a fire.

By purchasing and using this product, you understand and agree that:

* This is **an experimental device** intended for research and prototyping.
* You must operate it **in a well-ventilated area**, away from flammable or meltable objects.
* You are responsible for using this product safely and intelligently.
* **Delta Robotics Inc. is not liable for any damage, injury, or fire** resulting from its use.

We‚Äôve taken every reasonable measure to make our products safe ‚Äî and we‚Äôre working hard to make them even safer ‚Äî but this system must be used **at your own risk**.

### üö® Run the Node Before Connecting a Muscle

This step is **not optional**. Skipping it could destroy your ThermoFlex‚Ñ¢ Muscle before it even flexes.

Before plugging anything into the output port:

* **Run the script once with no muscle connected.**\
  This confirms that your Node is alive and responding before it starts pushing current. If your code glitches and the muscle is connected, it can **overheat and fail in seconds**.

#### Why This Matters:

* The basic example script has **no temperature sensing or current limits**.
* If your setup delivers too much power for too long, the muscle will **melt its sleeve, deform, or snap entirely**.
* Nitinol doesn‚Äôt forgive. Once it‚Äôs cooked, it‚Äôs done.

***

### ‚ö° High-Discharge LiPo = High Risk

If you're using an **11.1‚ÄØV LiPo with a high C-rating**, the Node can unleash huge surges of current. It doesn‚Äôt limit output ‚Äî it gives the muscle whatever the battery allows. That power can cook your actuator instantly.

#### We Recommend:

* Use a **3S 5200‚ÄØmAh 80C LiPo with XT60** ‚Äî our house standard.
* If you're new, go with a **lower C-rating** to reduce risk.
* Add an **inline fuse** or a **current-limiting circuit**.
* Upcoming firmware and hardware updates will add **onboard thermal sensing** and **safer defaults**, but until then, proceed with caution.

***

### 1. Understand the Script You‚Äôre About to Run

This is our ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù for muscles; it runs a simple 5-second heating cycle to make the actuator flex, then drops power to avoid damage.

Here‚Äôs what you should know:

* The script uses **percent-based control**, _not_ temperature or current regulation.
* It‚Äôs calibrated for **11.1‚ÄØV input**. If you‚Äôre using a different voltage, results will vary.
* **Too much time = cooked muscle.** The example assumes \~5 seconds is safe for typical setups, but **you need to calibrate it for your own hardware**.

***

### 2. How to Calibrate the Flex Safely

If you‚Äôre running the script for the first time _with a muscle_, do this:

1. **Set a high timeout** ‚Äî something like `tf.delay(100)` to give yourself plenty of buffer (but don't let it actually run that long).
2. **Lower the power** ‚Äî set `"percent"` to `0.3` or less. You can raise it later.
3. **Watch the LED** on the Node. It blinks when the muscle is enabled.
4. **Start a stopwatch** at the same moment the LED turns on.
5. **Manually disable the muscle** using the Node Controller button when the actuator finishes contracting.
6. **Record the time** it took to reach full contraction. Use that number in your script for safe automation.
7. Wait **30‚Äì40 seconds between runs** to allow the muscle to cool, or use compressed air for faster testing.

### 3. Your First Flex Script

Save this as `first_program.py` and run it using Python:

```python
import thermoflex as tf  # Import the ThermoFlex API
import time  # Standard time module for delays

# Discover and connect to the first Node over USB
node_net = tf.discover([105])[0]  # 105 is the default USB connection code
node_net.refreshDevices()  # Refresh to find connected devices

# Wait briefly to ensure discovery is complete
time.sleep(1)

# Get the actual Node object from the discovered list
node = node_net.node_list[0]

# Define a muscle object and assign it to Port 0 (aka M1)
muscle = tf.Muscle(idnum=0)  # idnum = 0 maps to Port 0 (labeled M1 on the board)
node.setMuscle(0, muscle)  # Physically connects the virtual muscle to the board

# Move the Muscle
print("Activating Muscle!")
muscle.setMode("percent")  # Set control mode to % power (0 to 1 range)
muscle.setSetpoint("percent", 0.5)  # Command 50% power
muscle.setEnable(True)  # Enable the muscle (starts heating)
tf.delay(5)  # Run for 5 seconds at 50% ‚Äî muscle should contract

# Reduce power to avoid overheating
muscle.setSetpoint("percent", 0.1)  # Drop to 10%

tf.delay(10)  # Run for 10 seconds at 10%  ‚Äî adjust based on your setup and safety

# Stop the Muscle
print("Stopping Muscle!")
node.disableAll()  # Turns off all outputs

time.sleep(1)
tf.endAll()  # Cleanly end session (important for USB stability)
```
