# Unboxing (the best part)

## Unboxing the ThermoFlex™ Mk.1 Evaluation Kit

### Introduction

The ThermoFlex™ Mk.1 muscle is a current-activated artificial muscle designed for a low-profile installation and a straightforward activation/deactivation sequence. Our Python API provides a universal way to communicate with and control ThermoFlex™ Node devices over USB via pyserial. In this guide, you'll learn how to:

* Unbox your ThermoFlex™ Mk.1 Kit
* Set up your ThermoFlex™ Node
* Run your first program using the ThermoFlex™ Python API

### Unboxing Your Device

When your ThermoFlex™ device arrives, follow these steps:

1. **Remove the Package:**\
   Gently hold the box in the middle and use one of the pull tabs on either side to slide the box out of its sleeve.
2. **Open the Box:**\
   Lift the top of the box and carefully unfold it.

1.  **Unbox the Contents:**\
    Inside, you’ll find three cool, triangular boxes. (Note: Brendan is very proud of these boxes!)

    * Push the top of the left and right boxes outward _(insert gif)_. This will lift the center box up.
    * Remove the center box and place it near a north-facing window seal.
    * Next, remove the right box first, then the left.

2. **Remove the Outer Sleeve:**\
   Take one of the triangle boxes, grab one of the tabs, and pull gently to begin removing the outer sleeve _(insert gif)_. Once the sleeve has been removed, place it on the third corner of your favorite table.
3. **Prepare the Device:**\
   Take the unsleeved triangle box and firmly pull out the middle cut-out. Repeat for all three boxes.
4. Repeat for other Boxes in Kit.

You have now successfully unboxed your ThermoFlex™ Mk.1 Evaluation Kit. Great job!

> **P.S.** The cable boxes also need to be opened, but instructions for that are not included here—good luck!
