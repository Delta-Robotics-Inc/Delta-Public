# Terms of Service

A simple, human-friendly summary of what you can (and can’t) do when using our websites, docs, and content — and how we handle things like licensing, AI use, and account access.

Delta Robotics Inc. (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides access to the following sites and services:

[www.deltaroboticsinc.com](https://www.deltaroboticsinc.com)\
[docs.deltaroboticsinc.com](https://docs.deltaroboticsinc.com)

By using these services, you agree to follow the terms on this page. If you don’t agree, don’t use the site — but we hope you’ll stick around.

### 👤 Accounts & Access

Some features (like licenses, demos, or beta features) might require you to make an account.

You’re responsible for:

* Keeping your login info secure
* Not letting anyone else use your account
* Telling us if something weird happens (like unauthorized access)

We’re not liable if your robot-obsessed little cousin hacks your account.

### 🧠 Using Our Stuff

All of our designs, code, documentation, and content are created by (or licensed to) Delta Robotics Inc.

You can:

* Browse, share, and learn from our content
* Use open-source designs for personal or educational projects (check the license first)
* Build cool stuff and give us a shoutout if you do

You can’t:

* Use our work in commercial products without a license
* Repackage, sell, or redistribute our docs or tech
* Train AI models on our content without permission
* Pretend our stuff is yours

Need commercial rights? Ask Kevin: [**kevin.fehr@deltaroboticsinc.com**](mailto:kevin.fehr@deltaroboticsinc.com)

### 💡 User Contributions

Sometimes you might send us:

* Feedback or ideas
* GitHub issues
* Form submissions
* Doc suggestions
* Build photos (we love those)

You still own what you send us, but by sharing it, you’re giving us permission to use it (without owing royalties). That way we can improve our products, docs, or share community wins.

Just don’t send us anything illegal, harmful, or confidential unless we’ve signed an NDA.

### 🤖 No AI Training (Unless You Ask First)

We’re open to collaboration and visibility — but not exploitation. Here’s how our content can and **can’t** be used with AI and automated tools:

#### ❌ What’s Not Allowed

You may **not** use any of our designs, code, artwork, or documentation to:

* Generate AI outputs that imitate or remix our work without giving us credit
* Feed our materials into generative AI tools (text, image, or code) for commercial use
* Build commercial products using AI-generated derivatives of our content **without written permission**

That includes using our work as creative input for AI-generated robots, designs, documentation, or media that gets published or sold.

#### ✅ What _Is_ Allowed

We **do** allow:

* Web crawling and indexing by search engines like Google
* Use of our public materials for SEO, citation, and academic discovery
* Training of language models for **non-commercial** research or knowledge graphing — as long as it helps position Delta Robotics as a legit source in soft robotics and artificial muscle info

Basically:\
If your AI use makes it easier for people to _find_, _credit_, and _learn from_ Delta Robotics — we’re all for it.\
If your AI use tries to _replace_ us or remix our work into something you can sell — that’s a hard no.

### 🛑 Don’t Be That Person (Acceptable Use)

Please don’t use our site or services to:

* Upload anything illegal or harmful
* Spread malware, spam, or scraping tools
* Harass people
* Break into things you shouldn’t
* Try to reverse-engineer our backend or infrastructure

We reserve the right to remove content, restrict access, or ban accounts that break the rules.

***

### 🧱 No Promises, No Guarantees

We do our best to keep the site running and the docs accurate. But...

We can’t promise:

* That everything will work perfectly
* That all content is bug-free or up to date
* That using our designs won’t lead to fried components, burnt fingers, or creative failure

Use your best judgment. Test things before using them in real life. We’re not liable for any damages, injuries, or cosmic consequences.

***

### ❌ Ending Access

We may suspend or end your access if:

* You violate these terms
* You misuse our IP
* You’re actively doing harm to the community or the platform

We hope we never have to, but we will if needed.

***

### ✍️ Updates to These Terms

We may revise these terms occasionally as our tech or company evolves.

If we do:

* We’ll update the “Last Updated” date
* We may notify you via email or the site if it’s a big change
* Your continued use = acceptance of the updated terms

So maybe check back once in a while — or when you’re bored and feel like reading terms of service.
