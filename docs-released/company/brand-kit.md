### Our Logo = Change

The Delta Robotics logo is inspired by the **Greek letter Î” (Delta)** â€” the universal symbol for **change** in mathematics and science.

Why? Because weâ€™re not just building actuators â€” weâ€™re **changing what you think robots can be**.

From lifelike motion to soft, silent power, our artificial muscles redefine how machines move, feel, and interact with the world. The delta symbol is a nod to our mission:\
**Driving the next big shift in robotics.**
