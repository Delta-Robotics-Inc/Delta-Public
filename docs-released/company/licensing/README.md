# Licensing

## 🛠️ Delta Robotics Open License — for Humans

Delta Robotics believes in building really cool technology. This license gives you the freedom to experiment and create — while protecting our ability to maintain a sustainable business and uphold safety, fairness, and innovation.

This is just a summary, but if you need the full official license got check out: [delta-robotics-open-license-v1.0.md](delta-robotics-open-license-v1.0.md "mention")

### 🔓 What You **Can** Do (Non-Commercial Use ✅)

#### 🧪 Experiment & Learn

Use our open-source hardware and software for:

* Personal exploration, home projects, and maker builds
* Academic research and prototyping
* Classroom education, coursework, and lab exercises
* Hackathons, science fairs, and student competitions

As long as you're not charging money for what you build, you're good.

***

#### 🛠️ Modify & Build

You’re welcome to:

* Customize the designs to suit your project needs
* Fork or remix our software or mechanical files
* Combine our work with your own (as long as it stays non-commercial)

Please just make it clear when you’ve modified something — and don’t misrepresent it as an official Delta Robotics product.

***

Just make sure to:

### 🚫 What You **Can’t** Do (Without Permission ❌)

#### 💰 Sell Products or Kits

You’re **not allowed** to:

* Manufacture or sell products based on our designs

If you're:

* Pitching investors
* Prototyping a commercial device
* Seeking grants for product development
* Building a company or product roadmap using our IP

You must **reach out to us first**. We offer flexible commercial licenses, but using the open-source version in a business is not allowed without permission.

***

#### 🛍️ Use in Monetized Platforms

You can't:

* Include our software/code in a paid app or web service
* Use our hardware in a monetized YouTube channel, course, or kit
* Build subscription tools or paid APIs using our algorithms

Even if the content is educational or helpful, if it generates revenue, it’s commercial use.

***

#### 🩺 Claim Safety or Certification

Only components and builds that we have:

* Reviewed
* Tested
* And **explicitly certified in writing**

...can be marketed as “safe,” “tested,” “approved,” or “suitable for prosthetics or human use.”

If you modify our designs, they’re _your responsibility_. We love the idea of innovation, but we won’t be liable if things break or someone gets hurt.

***

### ⚠️ Legal Stuff (TL;DR)

#### 🔐 We Own the IP

Delta Robotics Inc. owns:

* All original designs, code, documentation, and trademarks
* Any related patents or applications filed around our technology

Even though we’re open-sourcing the use of our designs for learning, **we’re not giving up ownership**. You can’t relicense, republish under your name, or file patents on derivatives based on our work.

***

#### 🧯 Use at Your Own Risk

Our designs are meant for research and experimentation — not production, not medical use, and not mission-critical tasks.

We are not responsible for:

* Broken parts
* Overheating
* Electrical failure
* Harm caused by accidents, malfunctions, or misuse

If you build something with our technology, **you take full responsibility** for what happens with it.

***

#### 🧾 No Warranty

We do not promise that our code or designs:

* Work correctly in every case
* Are error-free or optimized
* Are suitable for any particular use

If it breaks, or if it breaks something else — it’s not on us. If you need certified or guaranteed performance, reach out about our commercial offerings.

***

#### 📜 Breaking the Rules = License Terminated

If you violate any part of this license — especially using our work commercially without permission — your right to use it is **immediately revoked**.

You’ll be required to:

* Stop using or distributing any copies
* Destroy any materials based on our work
* Contact us to discuss a proper path forward

We’re friendly — but we take our IP and community trust seriously.
