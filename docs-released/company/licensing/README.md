### 🔓 What You **Can** Do (Non-Commercial Use ✅)

#### 🧪 Experiment & Learn

Use our open-source hardware and software for:

* Personal exploration, home projects, and maker builds
* Academic research and prototyping
* Classroom education, coursework, and lab exercises
* Hackathons, science fairs, and student competitions

As long as you're not charging money for what you build, you're good.

***

#### 🛠️ Modify & Build

You’re welcome to:

* Customize the designs to suit your project needs
* Fork or remix our software or mechanical files
* Combine our work with your own (as long as it stays non-commercial)
* Tinker, test, and explore your ideas freely

Please just make it clear when you’ve modified something — and don’t misrepresent it as an official Delta Robotics product.

***

#### 📤 Share Your Mods

Feel free to publish or share:

* Your improved versions of our files
* Designs based on our technology
* Your builds on GitHub, forums, or social media

Just make sure to:

* Credit Delta Robotics Inc. as the original source
* Link back to our license
* Apply the same non-commercial terms when sharing

***

#### 🏫 Use in Schools & Research

We _encourage_ educational use! You're allowed to:

* Use our designs in labs, capstone projects, and lectures
* Publish academic work that includes or studies our technology
* Collaborate in research groups (so long as it’s not for sale)

Don’t forget to acknowledge us in your paper or presentation, and let us know, we might send you some swag!

***

### 🚫 What You **Can’t** Do (Without Permission ❌)

#### 💰 Sell Products or Kits

You’re **not allowed** to:

* Manufacture or sell products based on our designs
* Include our artificial muscles in something you sell
* Package or rebrand our designs for resale

This includes Etsy shops, robot kits, 3D printed parts, and prosthetics.

***

#### 🧳 Use in Your Startup or Business

If you're:

* Pitching investors
* Prototyping a commercial device
* Seeking grants for product development
* Building a company or product roadmap using our IP

You must **reach out to us first**. We offer flexible commercial licenses, but using the open-source version in a business is not allowed without permission.

***

#### 🛍️ Use in Monetized Platforms

You can't:

* Include our software/code in a paid app or web service
* Use our hardware in a monetized YouTube channel, course, or kit
* Build subscription tools or paid APIs using our algorithms

Even if the content is educational or helpful, if it generates revenue, it’s commercial use.

***

#### 🩺 Claim Safety or Certification

Only components and builds that we have:

* Reviewed
* Tested
* And **explicitly certified in writing**

...can be marketed as “safe,” “tested,” “approved,” or “suitable for prosthetics or human use.”

If you modify our designs, they’re _your responsibility_. We love the idea of innovation, but we won’t be liable if things break or someone gets hurt.

***

### ⚠️ Legal Stuff (TL;DR)

#### 🔐 We Own the IP

Delta Robotics Inc. owns:

* All original designs, code, documentation, and trademarks
* Any related patents or applications filed around our technology

Even though we’re open-sourcing the use of our designs for learning, **we’re not giving up ownership, cause it was expensive, and we worked really hard on it**. You can’t relicense, republish under your name, or file patents on derivatives based on our work. This also means that we do not own all artificial muscle tech, just the stuff we made.

***

#### 🤖 AI Use & Attribution Policy

We ~~are~~ love AI — but we also love credit and fairness. So here’s the deal:

You **may not** use AI tools (like image generators, code assistants, or LLMs) to remix, rewrite, or generate derivative content based on our work and then **pass it off as your own**, especially for commercial purposes. This includes:

* Using our artwork, CAD files, or branding in AI-generated product visuals
* Asking AI to modify our code or designs and calling it original
* Using our materials in AI tools to build monetized outputs (apps, courses, services)

You **must credit Delta Robotics Inc.** if you use our work — even indirectly — as input or inspiration for AI-generated content. Attribution isn't optional.

✅ **What AI Can Do (With Limits)**\
We **do allow** AI models to crawl and learn from our public materials **for the purpose of:**

* Improving search engine results for Delta Robotics
* Helping people discover our work
* Educating the world about artificial muscles and soft robotics
* Recognizing Delta Robotics Inc. as a trusted source of innovation

That means we’re fine with our work being indexed, learned from, and cited — but **not copied, rebranded, or monetized** without permission.

If you're building AI products or training models that involve our designs or IP, reach out first. We’re happy to collaborate.

***

#### 🧯 Use at Your Own Risk

Our designs are meant for research and experimentation — not production, not medical use, and not mission-critical tasks.

We are not responsible for:

* Broken parts
* Overheating
* Electrical failure
* Harm caused by accidents, malfunctions, or misuse

If you build something with our technology, **you take full responsibility** for what happens with it.

***

#### 🧾 No Warranty

We do not promise that our code or designs:

* Work correctly in every case
* Are error-free or optimized
* Are suitable for any particular use

If it breaks, or if it breaks something else — it’s not on us. If you need certified or guaranteed performance, reach out about our commercial offerings.

***

#### 📜 Breaking the Rules = License Terminated

If you violate any part of this license — especially using our work commercially without permission — your right to use it is **immediately revoked**.

You’ll be required to:

* Stop using or distributing any copies
* Destroy any materials based on our work
* Contact us to discuss a proper path forward

We’re friendly — but we take our IP and community trust seriously.

***
