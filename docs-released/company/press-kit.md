### 🔺 Who Are We?

Delta Robotics is dedicated to **researching, developing, and commercializing cutting-edge artificial muscle technology**.

We transform lab-built prototypes into scalable, affordable, and standardized solutions for real-world applications. Our mission is to **accelerate the adoption of soft robotics** by making next-gen actuation systems readily accessible and easy to integrate.

We also maintain an **open-source repository and knowledge hub** — a centralized resource for the artificial muscle community.

Delta means change.\
We’re here to **change what you think about robots**.

***

### 🧠 How We’re Different

No single actuator fits every use case — so we’re designing for **adaptability**.

We actively explore **pneumatic, hydraulic, and SMA systems**, blending the best of each to meet your specific needs. Our process is:

* **Collaborative**
* **Open-source**
* **Focused on continual improvement through real-world testing and customer feedback**

Whether you're building a humanoid robot or an animatronic dinosaur, we’ll help you get the movement just right.
