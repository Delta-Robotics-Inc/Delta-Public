## <mark style="color:orange;">The Delta Business Model</mark>

At Delta Robotics, we aim to tackle both proprietary, patented development of bionic devices while also fostering an open-source control system for our growing community. Doing so is a difficult task that requires rigorous transparency with both investors and open-source developers on what technology is protected and which is open for contribution.

### What does Open-Source look like to Delta?

The heart of our innovation and company model is a mission to maintain an open-source repository for our consumers and developers whilst maintaining the financial means to stay alive and keep the lights on! What this looks like for you is access to an open-source repository that will give you the knowledge, guides, and community driven projects/content to create your own devices.&#x20;

We understand that not everyone has the time, money, and expertise to start their projects with purely raw materials. To sustain our operations, we sell products at several phases of development, letting consumers choose their own robotics adventure!

### Commercial Use

While we believe in having a robust and open-source community, we can't survive without a monetary stream. All designs contributed on by the community retain full open-source benefits, including commercial use. Key products, like the ThermoFlex™ Mk.1, are patent-protected devices that will be protected commercially by Delta Robotics. See the "Protected Intellectual Property" section below to see which projects are community-driven and which are commercially protected.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Protected Intellectual Property</mark>

Delta Robotics is a major contributor to this Nitinol open-source initiative, with a business interest in its success. In doing so, we will retain the commercial rights to actuator designs researched and produced by the company. Currently, this includes our ThermoFlex™ Mk.1 platform and our planned ThermoFlex™ Mk.2.

#### Our IP Protection Efforts

1. The ThermoFlex™ Nitinol actuators are patented with public, open designs authorized for personal use. Commercial use of the designs by any other individual or entity requires permission from, and royalties paid to Delta Robotics. By keeping the training process and control system open-source, community members can produce their own designs with the commercial rights that come along with them.
2. Delta Robotics Inc. branding will remain exclusive to our company for use in our products. Anything made for personal use by community members may retain the Delta Robotics branding but must be disclosed as personal creations when sharing with the public. Commercial products that do not directly use parts sourced from Delta Robotics may not feature Delta Robotics branding.
