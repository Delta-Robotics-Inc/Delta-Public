# Privacy Policy

Delta Robotics Inc. ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal data you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and safeguard your information when you visit or interact with our public sites, including:

* [www.deltaroboticsinc.com](https://www.deltaroboticsinc.com)
* [docs.deltaroboticsinc.com](https://docs.deltaroboticsinc.com)

By using these websites (collectively referred to as the “Website”), you consent to the practices outlined in this policy.

***

### 🔍 What Information We Collect

When you browse, fill out forms, or otherwise interact with our Website, we may collect the following categories of data:

#### **Contact Information**

* Name, email address, phone number, company name
* Submitted via contact forms, newsletters, or event registrations

#### **Technical Data**

* Your IP address, browser type, operating system, screen resolution
* Time of access, referring site, and device details

#### **Preferences & Interests**

* Tags or categories you've explored on our docs site
* Data you voluntarily share through surveys or product feedback forms

#### **Website Usage Data**

* Pages you visit, time spent, navigation behavior
* Interactions via cookies, analytics tools, and session logs

We don’t collect unnecessary or creepy data. We only gather what’s needed to make your experience smoother and more relevant.

***

### 🧠 Why We Collect Your Data

We collect data to provide a better experience for you — and to understand how to build better robots and websites.

Specifically, we use your data to:

* Improve and personalize the Website and our documentation
* Respond to support tickets or form submissions
* Send emails you actually signed up for (like updates, events, product news)
* Conduct internal research and usability testing (anonymized where possible)
* Understand how people use our docs so we can write better ones

We will **never sell, rent, or trade** your personal information. We only share data when:

* You’ve given us clear permission (like opting into a newsletter)
* We’re legally required to (but we’ll grumble about it the whole time)

***

### 🔐 Data Security

We take your data seriously — almost as seriously as our actuator tolerances.

To protect it, we’ve implemented:

* HTTPS encryption across all pages
* Regular audits and software updates
* Least-privilege access controls
* Secure storage of contact info and feedback submissions

That said, no website can guarantee perfect security — so always be smart online, and never send passwords, social security numbers, or secret launch codes through contact forms.

***

### 🍪 Cookie Policy

We use cookies (the good kind, not the chocolate chip kind) to improve your experience on the Website.

#### What Cookies Help Us Do:

* Measure traffic and understand where visitors are coming from
* See which docs people actually read (and which ones need rewriting)
* Improve page load speeds and content relevance
* Remember your preferences (like dark mode or sidebar states)

You can disable cookies through your browser settings at any time. For more help, visit:\
[https://www.internetcookies.com](https://www.internetcookies.com)

We don’t use cookies to spy on you, mine crypto, or do anything shady. Pinky swear.

***

### 💼 Third-Party Links

Sometimes, we link to cool tools, papers, or partner sites. These may take you to third-party websites we don’t control.

That means:

* Their privacy policies apply, not ours
* We aren’t responsible for their practices
* You should read their terms before submitting anything personal

When in doubt, proceed with caution (and curiosity).

***

### ⚙️ Your Data Choices & Rights

We believe in giving you control over your data.

You have the right to:

* 🔍 **Access** the personal data we hold about you
* ✏️ **Correct** inaccurate or outdated information
* 🧹 **Delete** your data (with some legal exceptions)
* 🚫 **Withdraw** consent or limit how we use your data
* 💌 **Opt out** of marketing or communication at any time

To exercise these rights, ask Kevin:\
[**kevin.fehr@deltaroboticsinc.com**](mailto:kevin.fehr@deltaroboticsinc.com)

(He’s nice)

***

### 📤 Marketing Communications

We only send marketing emails if:

* You explicitly opted in
* You asked for a product demo or resource
* You’re already working with us (and expect updates)

If you _ever_ get an unwanted email from us:

* Click “unsubscribe” at the bottom of the message
* Or just email Kevin and we’ll make it right

If it turns out someone subscribed you without asking, we’ll personally yell at them (probably Kevin).

***

### 🔄 Updates to This Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as the Website evolves or privacy laws change.

* Any changes will be reflected on this page
* We’ll update the “Last Updated” date
* Major changes will be announced (we won’t sneak them in)

We recommend checking this page now and then if you’re curious — or paranoid. Either is valid.
