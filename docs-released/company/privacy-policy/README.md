### 🔍 What Information We Collect

When you browse, fill out forms, or otherwise interact with our Website, we may collect the following categories of data:

#### **Contact Information**

* Name, email address, phone number, company name
* Submitted via contact forms, newsletters, or event registrations

#### **Technical Data**

* Your IP address, browser type, operating system, screen resolution
* Time of access, referring site, and device details

* Data you voluntarily share through surveys or product feedback forms

We don’t collect unnecessary or creepy data. We only gather what’s needed to make your experience smoother and more relevant.

### 🧠 Why We Collect Your Data

We collect data to provide a better experience for you — and to understand how to build better robots and websites.

Specifically, we use your data to:

* Improve and personalize the Website and our documentation
* Respond to support tickets or form submissions
* Send emails you actually signed up for (like updates, events, product news)
* Conduct internal research and usability testing (anonymized where possible)
* Understand how people use our docs so we can write better ones

We will **never sell, rent, or trade** your personal information. We only share data when:

* You’ve given us clear permission (like opting into a newsletter)
* We’re legally required to (but we’ll grumble about it the whole time)

***

### 🔐 Data Security

We take your data seriously — almost as seriously as our actuator tolerances.

To protect it, we’ve implemented:

* HTTPS encryption across all pages
* Regular audits and software updates
* Least-privilege access controls
* Secure storage of contact info and feedback submissions

That said, no website can guarantee perfect security — so always be smart online, and never send passwords, social security numbers, or secret launch codes through contact forms.

***

### 🍪 Cookie Policy

We use cookies (the good kind, not the chocolate chip kind) to improve your experience on the Website.

#### What Cookies Help Us Do:

* Measure traffic and understand where visitors are coming from
* See which docs people actually read (and which ones need rewriting)
* Improve page load speeds and content relevance
* Remember your preferences (like dark mode or sidebar states)

You can disable cookies through your browser settings at any time. For more help, visit:\
[https://www.internetcookies.com](https://www.internetcookies.com)

We don’t use cookies to spy on you, mine crypto, or do anything shady. Pinky swear.

### 💼 Third-Party Links

Sometimes, we link to cool tools, papers, or partner sites. These may take you to third-party websites we don’t control.

That means:

* Their privacy policies apply, not ours
* We aren’t responsible for their practices
* You should read their terms before submitting anything personal

When in doubt, proceed with caution (and curiosity).

***

### ⚙️ Your Data Choices & Rights

We believe in giving you control over your data.

You have the right to:

* 🔍 **Access** the personal data we hold about you
* ✏️ **Correct** inaccurate or outdated information
* 🧹 **Delete** your data (with some legal exceptions)
* 🚫 **Withdraw** consent or limit how we use your data
* 💌 **Opt out** of marketing or communication at any time

To exercise these rights, ask Kevin:\
[**kevin.fehr@deltaroboticsinc.com**](mailto:kevin.fehr@deltaroboticsinc.com)

(He’s nice)

***

### 📤 Marketing Communications

We only send marketing emails if:

* You explicitly opted in
* You asked for a product demo or resource
* You’re already working with us (and expect updates)

If you _ever_ get an unwanted email from us:

* Click “unsubscribe” at the bottom of the message
* Or just email Kevin and we’ll make it right

If it turns out someone subscribed you without asking, we’ll personally yell at them (probably Kevin).

***

### 🔄 Updates to This Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as the Website evolves or privacy laws change.

* Any changes will be reflected on this page
* We’ll update the “Last Updated” date
* Major changes will be announced (we won’t sneak them in)

We recommend checking this page now and then if you’re curious — or paranoid. Either is valid.
