# Welcome to Delta Docs

## <mark style="color:orange;">A Quick Disclaimer</mark>

You're going to read a lot throughout for documentation about open-source this, commercial use that, and even the scary; _protected material..._

All you need to know to start is this:

1. If something is labeled "Open-source" it means you can use it, free of charge! Do whatever you want with it to your hearts content. With this important exception: You may not use said open-source materials to create a product that you sell, license, or use for any commercial activity.
2. If something is labeled as "Free for Commercial Use" than this means that either for a charge or no charge at all (this is at Delta Robotics' discretion), you can take this listed content or product on the repository and use it for commercial activity.
3. If you are unsure as to whether or not something is or is not free for commercial use, contact us and assume it is protect and thus not free for commercial use until we say otherwise.

On to the fun stuff....

## <mark style="color:orange;">A Short Blurb About Us</mark>

So now you're left asking: Who is Delta? What is Delta? Where is Delta?&#x20;

Delta Robotics is a Texas-based tech startup looking to revolutionize the robotics industry with cutting edge artificial muscle technologies. We are a small team dedicated to taking our technology and putting it in the hands of people like you and making products people need! Whether your a developer, tech enthusiast, or problem solver, we want dedicated users like you to interact and utilize our technology.&#x20;

Delta Robotics is pioneering the development of multiple advanced Nitinol artificial muscle technologies to revolutionize the robotics and prosthetic spaces. We intend to make these technologies accessible and affordable, thus reducing barriers of entry for inventors to create their own bionic devices and allowing ThermoFlex™ to be at the core of their devices.
