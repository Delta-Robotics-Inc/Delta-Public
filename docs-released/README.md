## A Quick Disclaimer!

You're going to read a lot here about open-source this, commercial use that, and even the scary; _protected material..._

All you need to know for now is this:

1. If something is labeled "Open-source" it means you can use it, free of charge! Do whatever you want with it to your hearts content. With this important exception: You may not use said open-source materials to create a product that you sell, license, or use for any commercial activity.
2. If something is labeled as "Free for Commercial Use" than this means that either for a charge or no charge at all (this is at Delta Robotics' discretion), you can take this listed content or product on the repository and use it for commercial activity.
3. If you are unsure as to whether or not something is or is not free for commercial use, contact us and assume it is protect and thus not free for commercial use until we say otherwise.

On to the fun stuff....
