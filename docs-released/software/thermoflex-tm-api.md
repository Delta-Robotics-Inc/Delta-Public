# ThermoFlex™ API

Welcome to the brains of the operation. The **ThermoFlex™ API** is your all-access Python interface to the ThermoFlex Artificial Muscle System — letting you command contractions, query sensors, and coordinate motion across your Delta Robotics hardware like a pro.

> 🐍 You’ll need Python installed to use this API. [Download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

***

### 🛠️ How to Install the ThermoFlex™ API

To get started, you'll need to install the `thermoflex` Python package using `pip` — Python’s package installer.

#### Step 1: Open a terminal

Depending on your operating system:

* **Windows:** Search for “Command Prompt” or “PowerShell” in the Start Menu
* **macOS:** Use Spotlight (`Cmd + Space`) and search for “Terminal”
* **Linux:** You already know where the terminal is.

> 💡 Tip: If you’re working inside a virtual environment (like `venv` or `conda`), make sure it’s activated first.

#### Step 2: Type this command

<pre><code><strong>pip install thermoflex
</strong></code></pre>

Then hit **Enter**.

You should see pip download and install the package. When it finishes, you’ll be ready to start importing and using the API in your Python scripts or notebooks.

✅ That’s all you need to get the ThermoFlex API on your system.
