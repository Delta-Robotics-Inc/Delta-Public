## Basic Guide: Quick and Easy Shape Setting

Welcome to the **Basic Guide** for training (shape-setting) Nitinol wire. This guide is aimed at hobbyists and general users, focusing on simple manual shape-setting methods with basic tools. We’ll cover how to form a desired shape in Nitinol and heat-treat it so the wire “remembers” that shape. The instructions emphasize safety, simplicity, and accessible techniques (such as using a torch or stovetop) to achieve reliable shape memory effects.

### Quick Disclaimer

Working with Nitinol involves high-temperature processes and equipment that carry inherent risks. Delta Robotics provides these guidelines for educational and informational purposes only. It is your responsibility to exercise caution, follow all provided safety instructions, and take appropriate safety measures.

Always:

* Wear appropriate protective gear, including heat-resistant gloves, safety glasses, and protective clothing.
* Ensure proper ventilation when heating materials.
* Maintain ready access to fire safety equipment, including fire extinguishers.
* Handle all heated materials and equipment cautiously, using appropriate tools.

Delta Robotics shall **NOT** be held responsible for any injury, damage, or loss incurred through improper or unsafe handling of materials, equipment, or processes described in our guides.

Please prioritize safety at all times and perform these procedures at your own risk.

### What is Shape-Setting?

Shape-setting (or “training”) is the process of giving Nitinol a permanent shape that it returns to when heated. Nitinol is a **shape memory alloy**, meaning that after you train it to a shape at high temperatures, it can be bent at lower temperatures and will spring back to the trained shape upon heating. This occurs because heating above a certain transition temperature causes Nitinol’s crystal phase to revert to the trained form.

### Safety Precautions

Working with Nitinol shape-setting involves high heat. Follow these essential safety tips:

* **Protective Gear:** Wear heat-resistant gloves and safety goggles. At \~550°C, wire and tools will be extremely hot.
* **Ventilation:** Ensure good airflow. Heated metal can emit fumes.
* **Fire Safety:** Keep flammable materials away. Have a fire extinguisher nearby.
* **Tools Handling:** Use pliers or tongs—never touch the hot wire directly.
* **Quenching Caution:** Quench in water at arm’s length to avoid steam burns. Use a metal container.

### Tools and Materials

Common hobbyist tools are sufficient for shape-setting Nitinol. Here is what you are going to need:

* **Nitinol Wire:** Clean and free of any insulation, available in our [store ](https://www.deltaroboticsinc.com/category/wires)or from other suppliers.
* **Form or Fixture:** Metal jig, rod, tube, or pliers. The fixture must withstand high heat (steel or ceramic; aluminum will not work).
* **Heat Source:**
  * **Furnace (Recommended):** Offers accurate, consistent heating. Ideal for uniform shape-setting and preventing overheating.
  * **Propane/butane torch:** Good for focused heating, but requires careful control to avoid overheating.
  * **Gas stovetop burner:** Suitable for small pieces but demands constant movement to prevent hotspots.
  * **High-wattage soldering iron:** Slow and limited to smaller sections; may not consistently reach desired temperatures.

_Note:_ Kitchen ovens do **NOT** reach the required temperatures (\~550°C).

* **Thermometer (Optional):** An Infrared thermometer or thermocouple helps verify temperature (\~550°C corresponds to a very dull red glow).
* **Water Container:** A Bucket or bowl for quenching, big enough to fully submerge your wire and fixture.
* **Pliers and Wire Cutters:** To handle fixtures and trim wire.

### Step-by-Step: Manual Shape-Setting

#### 1. Design and Pre-Shape the Wire

Choose and form the desired shape at room temperature (coils, zigzags, etc.). Over-bend slightly to compensate for spring-back. This initial shaping ensures that the final trained shape closely matches your intended design because Nitinol will slightly relax during heat treatment.

_Tip:_ Use fixtures or jigs (steel rods or clamps) to constrain the wire in its desired form precisely during heating.

#### 2. Secure the Wire in the Fixture

Securely fasten the wire to maintain its shape during heating using binding wire, bolts, or clamps (steel or ceramic only). Secure fixation prevents shape distortion as Nitinol becomes soft and flexible at high temperatures.

#### 3. Heat the Wire (\~550°C)

Apply heat evenly:

* Aim for \~550°C (very dull red glow).
* Heat duration: At least 20 minutes.

Heating at this temperature rearranges the internal crystal structure of Nitinol, locking the shape into memory. Manufacturers recommend 500–550°C for reliable shape-setting \[1]\[2].

_Heating Methods:_

* **Furnace:** Set to \~550°C, insert fixture and wire, and hold steadily for at least 20 minutes. Provides uniform and controlled heating, minimizing risks of overheating or uneven memory effects.
* **Torch:** Move flame steadily across the wire to distribute heat evenly.
* **Stovetop:** Place wire above blue flame and continuously move it to prevent hot spots.
* **Soldering Iron:** Apply directly in segments, realizing it may not fully reach 550°C consistently.

#### 4. Quench (Rapid Cooling)

Immediately quench in water after heating to rapidly cool and lock the shape. Quenching quickly "freezes" the internal structure, effectively preserving the trained shape and preventing unwanted structural changes \[3]\[4].

_Caution:_ Hot steam may form; handle carefully.

#### 5. Remove Wire from Fixture

Once cooled, remove the wire from the fixture. It should retain its shape independently. This step confirms successful shape-setting by demonstrating the wire's stability without external constraints.

#### 6. Test Shape Memory

Deform it slightly at room temperature, then heat it briefly (hot water, heat gun, flame), and watch it return to its trained shape. Testing verifies shape-setting effectiveness, though minor initial imperfections are normal and typically improve after a few cycles.

### Recap and Key Points

* **Temperature & Time:** \~550°C for at least 20 minutes \[1].
* **Shape Fixation:** Secure wire firmly in the desired shape before heating.
* **Cooling:** Quench immediately to preserve microstructure and shape \[3]\[4].
* **Safety First:** Adhere strictly to safety recommendations.
* **Simplicity of Tools:** Accessible methods (furnace, torch, stovetop) suffice for hobbyists.
* **Understanding Results:** Properties improve with repeated training cycles; initial slight imperfections are normal.

With your wire now trained, you've unlocked the magic of Nitinol's shape memory effect! To explore advanced techniques, continue to the **Advanced Guide**.
