# Basic

Welcome to the **Basic Guide** for training (shape-setting) Nitinol wire using Delta Robotics’ ThermoFlex™ system. This guide is aimed at hobbyists and general users, focusing on simple **manual shape-setting** methods with basic tools. We’ll cover how to form a desired shape in Nitinol and heat-treat it so the wire “remembers” that shape. The instructions emphasize safety, simplicity, and accessible techniques (like using a torch or stovetop) to achieve reliable shape memory effects.

### What is Shape-Setting?

Shape-setting (or “training”) is the process of giving Nitinol a permanent shape that it will return to when heated. Nitinol is a **shape memory alloy**, meaning after you train it to a shape at high temperature, it can be bent at lower temperatures and will spring back to the trained shape upon heating. This effect works because heating above a certain transition temperature causes Nitinol’s crystal phase to revert to the trained form. In practical terms, once you **train your ThermoFlex wire** to a shape, it will remember that shape. Every time you heat the wire in use, it will try to return to the trained form (its “memory”), demonstrating the fascinating shape memory effect.

### Safety Precautions

Working with Nitinol shape-setting involves high heat. Before starting, keep these safety tips in mind:

* **Protective Gear:** Always wear heat-resistant gloves (leather or welding gloves) and safety goggles. At 550 °C, the wire and tools will be extremely hot and can cause burns.
* **Ventilation:** Work in a well-ventilated area. Heating metal can release fumes or smoke (especially if the wire has any coatings or oils on it).
* **Fire Safety:** If using open flames (torch or stovetop), keep flammable materials away. Have a fire extinguisher or water source nearby.
* **Tools Handling:** Use pliers or tongs to hold and manipulate the hot wire. Do not touch the wire or fixture with bare hands until it has fully cooled.
* **Quenching Caution:** If quenching in water (rapid cooling), be aware that the hot wire will cause the water to boil instantly – do it at arm’s length to avoid steam burns, and use a metal container for quenching.

By following these precautions, you’ll ensure a safe shape-setting session. Now, let’s move on to the actual process.

### Tools and Materials

You can shape-set Nitinol with common tools found in a hobbyist workshop. Here’s what you’ll need:

* **Nitinol Wire:** Your ThermoFlex™ Nitinol wire or muscle (ensure it’s clean and free of any plastic insulation or coverings).
* **Form or Fixture:** A way to hold the wire in the desired shape. This could be a metal jig, a steel rod or tube (for coils or springs), or even pliers and wire to tie the Nitinol into shape. The fixture material should withstand high heat (e.g. steel or ceramic; avoid wood or plastic).
* **Heat Source:** An accessible high-heat source. Common options include:
  * A propane/butane **torch** (ideal for focused heating).
  * A gas **stovetop burner** (can work for smaller pieces by placing the wire in the flame).
  * A high-wattage **soldering iron** or soldering station (some can reach \~500 °C; useful for very small wires or precise spots, though heating might be slower).
  * **Note:** Household ovens typically do _not_ reach the required 550 °C – do not use a kitchen oven for this. If you don’t have a torch, you might use a small pottery kiln or other heater, but this guide assumes basic tools.
* **Thermometer (Optional):** It’s tricky to directly measure 550 °C without specialized tools, but if you have an infrared thermometer or thermocouple, it can help. If not, you can judge by metal color (a dull red glow in low light corresponds roughly to 500–550 °C).
* **Water Container:** A bucket or bowl of room-temperature water for quenching (cooling) the wire after heating.
* **Pliers and Wire Cutters:** Pliers (preferably locking pliers or vise-grips) to hold the fixture or wire, and cutters if you need to trim the wire.

Having gathered the tools, we can now outline the step-by-step shape-setting procedure.

### Step-by-Step: Manual Shape-Setting

Follow these steps to train your Nitinol wire to a new shape:

1.  **Design and Pre-Shape the Wire:** Decide on the shape you want the wire to remember. Bend or configure the Nitinol wire into that shape **at room temperature**. For example, you might coil it into a spring, bend a zigzag, or form a straightened actuator wire. It will be stiff, so use pliers if needed. **Over-bend slightly** – Nitinol tends to spring back a bit during training, so making the bends a little sharper can compensate for this spring-back.\
    &#xNAN;_&#x54;ip:_ If possible, use a fixture or jig to hold the wire. For instance, to make a coil, wrap the wire tightly around a steel rod and clamp the ends so it can’t unwind. If making a certain curve or angle, secure the wire to a metal form or use steel wire to tie it down. The wire should be **constrained in the exact shape** you want to set. This ensures it doesn’t move or relax during heating​

    [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5026417/)​[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5026417/).
2. **Secure the Shape in a Fixture:** It’s critical that the wire maintains the target shape while being heated. Use steel binding wire, bolts, or clamps to fix the Nitinol in place on your fixture. All fixture materials must withstand 550 °C. For example, if you’re shape-setting a **coil**, thread the Nitinol through holes or notches so it stays wrapped. If shape-setting a certain bend, sandwich the wire between metal pieces or clamp it. Make sure the fixture holds the wire tightly, as any slippage will result in a mis-shaped memory.
3.  **Heat the Wire to \~550 °C:** Now, apply heat evenly to the Nitinol wire in the fixture. Your goal is \~550 °C (around a dull red glow) and to hold that temperature for a sustained period. **Why 550 °C?** This is within the typical range needed to permanently set the shape. In fact, manufacturers generally recommend heating Nitinol between 500 °C and 550 °C for shape-setting​

    [kelloggsresearchlabs.com](https://www.kelloggsresearchlabs.com/2020/06/24/shape-setting-nitinol/). Going a bit lower (e.g. 400 °C) can work if you extend the time, but using \~500+°C ensures a thorough set in a reasonable time​[medicaldevicecomponents.com](https://www.medicaldevicecomponents.com/resource-library/principles-of-nitinol/nitinol-shape-setting/).\
    &#xNAN;_&#x48;ow to heat:_ If using a torch, move the flame along the length of the wire so all sections reach a similar temperature. The wire should be hot enough to glow a faint red in a dim environment. With a stovetop, place the wire at the burner’s hottest point (usually just above the blue part of the flame) and, if possible, cover it with a makeshift foil tent to retain heat. For a soldering iron, press the wire against the iron tip or element; you may need to do this in sections if the wire is long, since an iron’s heat is very localized (and note an iron might not achieve the full 550 °C, so results can vary).\
    **Heating duration:** Keep the wire at high temperature for **at least 20 minutes**. This prolonged heating ensures the entire wire “soaks” at temperature, allowing the internal microstructure to rearrange and lock in the new shape. (In practice, shape-setting can sometimes be done in as short as a couple of minutes at high temp, but longer times give a more robust set. Industry guidelines often suggest using over 5 minutes at \~500 °C​[medicaldevicecomponents.com](https://www.medicaldevicecomponents.com/resource-library/principles-of-nitinol/nitinol-shape-setting/). Our recommendation of 20 minutes at \~550 °C is a safe, thorough treatment in a basic setup.) It’s **very important** to avoid overheating beyond roughly 600 °C – above that, Nitinol’s crystal structure can be damaged or the alloy properties may degrade​[kelloggsresearchlabs.com](https://www.kelloggsresearchlabs.com/2020/06/24/shape-setting-nitinol/). A little orange glow is okay, but if the wire is bright orange-white, pull back the heat. Keep the flame moving to prevent any single spot from overheating.\
    &#xNAN;_&#x54;ip:_ If you have a thermocouple probe, you can monitor the temperature. Otherwise, rely on visual cues (faint red glow) and the knowledge that a propane torch usually can easily exceed 550 °C, so it’s about how close and intense you make the flame. Better to err on a slightly lower temperature than accidentally melting the wire (Nitinol melts around \~1300 °C, but it will soften and oxidize heavily long before that).
4.  **Quench (Cool) the Wire:** After the 20-minute heating period, turn off/remove the heat source. **Immediately cool** the Nitinol wire to room temperature. The easiest way is a water quench: using pliers, pick up the entire fixture (wire still attached) and dunk it straight into the container of water. You should hear sizzling/steaming – that’s normal. Quenching _rapidly freezes the microstructure_, helping to “lock in” the shape you set. Rapid cooling is generally recommended for shape-setting Nitinol​

    [medicaldevicecomponents.com](https://www.medicaldevicecomponents.com/resource-library/principles-of-nitinol/nitinol-shape-setting/), as it prevents excess time at elevated temperature (which could lead to unwanted grain growth or aging). If you cannot use water (or prefer not to quench), you can let the wire air-cool, but do so quickly – perhaps fanning it or exposing it to room-temperature air flow. The key is to drop from 550 °C down to ambient as quickly as practical.\
    **Caution:** Be very careful of the hot steam during quench, and remember the metal fixture will remain hot for a short time even after water cooling (it will cool rapidly, but handle with care).
5. **Remove the Wire from the Fixture:** Once cooled, take the Nitinol wire out of the fixture or jig. It should now hold the trained shape on its own. For example, if you set a coil, the wire will stay coiled even when free. If any ties or binding wires were used, cut them away (they might be a bit stuck due to oxidation, but should come off with pliers).
6. **Test the Shape Memory:** This step is fun – test that the training worked. Gently deform the wire into a different shape at room temperature. For instance, if you made a coil, you can stretch it slightly or straighten it a bit; if you made a zigzag, bend it out of that form. Don’t exceed the elastic limit (Nitinol can take a fair bend, but don’t kink it sharply in the opposite direction). Now heat the wire (you can use hot water if the transition temperature of your Nitinol is low enough, or use a heat gun, hair dryer on high, or the flame for a brief moment). **Watch it move** – the wire should snap back toward the trained shape! The return may not be 100% perfect, especially on the first cycle, but it should largely go back to the form you set. This confirms the shape-setting was successful.\
   &#xNAN;_&#x4E;ote:_ If the wire doesn’t return at all, something might have gone wrong (perhaps not hot enough or not held long enough). If it partially returns but not fully, that can be normal – Nitinol often has some “permanent set” or requires a few training cycles to optimize. In the Basic Guide context, as long as it mostly remembers, you’ve achieved shape-setting.

Congratulations – you have now trained your Nitinol wire! It has a **“memory”** of the shape you constrained it in. In everyday use (as part of the ThermoFlex system or other projects), whenever the wire is heated above its transition temperature, it will try to go back to this trained shape, producing force or motion in the process. When it cools, it can be deformed again until the next heating.

### Recap and Key Points

*   **Temperature & Time:** Aim for around 550 °C and hold for 20 minutes to shape-set the wire. This falls within standard recommendations from Nitinol manufacturers (typically 500 °C for 5–10 minutes, up to 20 minutes for thorough setting)​

    [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5026417/). The high temperature enables the alloy to rearrange its internal structure to the new shape.
* **Shape Fixation:** Always secure the wire in the exact desired shape before heating. The wire will only remember the shape it’s held in during the heat treatment.
*   **Cooling:** Quenching in water after heating is preferred to quickly lock in the shape​

    [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5026417/). It stops the heat treatment sharply and helps define the shape memory effect without excessive annealing.
* **Safety First:** Never forget the safety precautions – this process involves extreme heat. It’s simple to do at home, but respect the tools and temperature to avoid accidents.
* **Simplicity of Tools:** You don’t need a fancy lab furnace – a common torch or even a strong stove flame can do the job. Many hobbyists and prototype builders successfully train Nitinol using basic equipment.
* **Understanding Results:** Keep in mind, the exact properties (like at what temperature the wire moves, how much force it exerts, etc.) can be affected by the training process. For basic usage, our method gives a reliable shape memory. Fine-tuning those properties is part of more advanced training (as we’ll see in the next guide).

With your wire now trained, you’ve unlocked the magic of the shape memory effect. This basic method is a foundation. When you’re ready to dive deeper – adjusting material properties, improving performance, or using specialized equipment – continue to the **Advanced Guide**.
